    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/2 cup orange juice </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup lime juice </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic </li>
        <li> 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced </li>
        <li> 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk together the orange juice, lime juice, cumin, garlic, and jalapeno
            pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken
            breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.
            Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the
            heat source. Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off excess.
            Discard the remaining marinade. Place the chicken on a broiling pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the
            juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
